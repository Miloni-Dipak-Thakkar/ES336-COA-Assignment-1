# Question 1
### Write a C program to multiply square matrices of size N x N where N is at-least 1024. Use either int or float data types. Compute the time needed to execute multiplication. You may use and refer timespec or timeval functions. As a part of compilation generate the intermediate. Observe and highlight the changes in .i and .s files. Execute the binary program with ‘time’’ command.

```c
for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
    for (j = 0; j < N; j++)
        for (k = 0; k < N; k++)
            C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
```

## Compilation Steps
```c
gcc -E matmul.c > matmul.i
gcc -S matmul.c > matmul.s
gcc matmul.c -o matmul.out
```

## Observations

-The .i file contains expanded macros and included header file.
-The .s file shows low-level assembly instructions generated by the compiler.
-Execution time is high due to O(N³) complexity.
-Performance is limited by cache misses and memory access patterns.
